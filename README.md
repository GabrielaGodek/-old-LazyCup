# LazyCup
Single Page Application that allows you to buy your favorite coffee without waiting in long line at coffee house.

With this project, I became more comfortable with Vue, managing state with Pinia, and delivering props through components. I also developed automated unit tests with Vitest.

5. It will open localhost at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`
